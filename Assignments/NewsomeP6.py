# Purpose: Use functions to calcuolate disance between two points.

# You are going to write a program that calculates the distance between two geographic points.
# Your program will have the following functions
## A “header” function that takes no parameters and returns nothing that displays a header. The header will print a summary explaining the purpose of the program.
## A “get_location” function that takes no parameters, asks the user for a latitude and longitude and returns a tuple or list with the latitude and longitude. Make sure you tell the user what units to enter their information in!
## A “distance” function that takes two tuples, each with a latitude and longitude, calculates the distance between those two geographic points and returns the distance.

# In the main part of the program (after declaring your functions):
# Call the Header function that displays a header.
# Program should allow the user to do multiple calculations. Use a “do another?” loop.
# Inside the loop the program will do the following:
# Call the get_location function to get the first location.
# Call the get_location function again to get the second location.
# Call the distance function passing in the two locations above as arguments.
# Display a nicely formatted message to the user telling them the distance between those two locations.
# Finally ask the user if they want to do another.
# When done display a good bye message outside the loop.
