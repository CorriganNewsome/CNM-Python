# v.	Your program will evaluate who won or if there was a tie.

# vi.	The program reports what the computer chose, the userâ€™s choice, who won that round, and game tally. The game tally shows number of rounds, wins/losses for the player and number of ties.

# vii.	Ask the player if the user wants to play again.

# c.	When done display a goodbye message.
